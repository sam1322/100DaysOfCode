First of all I am not doing any things with consistency 

I need a solid plan

For the past 4 years I couldn't improve my rank in codeforces , codechef , leetcode .

As consistency has been missing .

I should start doing codeforces ,  leetcode again .
Stop thinking about how much time you would have to spend .
STOP LETTING YOURSELF TO STOP U .

First I must be consistent.

THINGS I WANT TO ACHIEVE
1)Become financially free and independent(means Get a good job ie salary atleast above 10-15 lakhs)
2)Get a rank more than 1800 in codeforces
3)Create more react projects

Yesterday I went to the college for the second time in two months
Man , now all those students who got job are now doing internship in their respective jobs and here I can't even fucking crack a job.
Motherfucker
I need to track my progress because I barely know whether I am making progress or not
  
I also need to discipline myself.

I keep getting distracted by manga & youtube .
