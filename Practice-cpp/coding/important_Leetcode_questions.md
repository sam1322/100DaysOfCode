### Question: Identify this problem as one of the categories below before continuing.

1. 0/1 Knapsack
2. Unbounded Knapsack
3. Shortest Path (eg: Unique Paths I/II)
4. Fibonacci Sequence (eg: House Thief, Jump Game)
5. Longest Common Substring/Subsequeunce

### Binary Search
#### Tip1. left < right Vs left <= right

Check all my solution, I keep using left < right.
The easy but important approach:
follow and upvote my codes(lee215),
try to do the same.you'll find all binary search is similar,
never bother thinking it anymore.

#### Tip2. mid = (left + right + 1) / 2 Vs mid = (left + right) / 2

mid = (left + right) / 2 to find first element valid
mid = (left + right + 1) / 2 to find last element valid
