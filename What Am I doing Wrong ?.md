### First of all I am not doing any things with consistency 

# I need a solid plan.

### For the past 4 years I couldn't improve my rank in codeforces , codechef , leetcode .

As consistency has been missing .

I should start doing codeforces ,  leetcode again .
Stop thinking about how much time you would have to spend .
STOP LETTING YOURSELF TO STOP U .

First I must be consistent.

## THINGS I WANT TO ACHIEVE

1) Become financially free and independent(means Get a good job ie salary atleast above 10-15 lakhs)
2) ~~Get a rank more than 1800 in codeforces~~
3) Create more react projects AND learn more technologies like ML, blockchain , solidity ,flutter and java.
4) Master the Data Structures and Algorithm

Yesterday I went to the college for the second time in two months
Man , now all those students who got job are now doing internship in their respective jobs and here I can't even fucking crack a job.
Motherfucker.
I need to track my progress because I barely know whether I am making progress or not
  
I also need to discipline myself.

I keep getting distracted by manga & youtube .

Things are getting better. Now a days I am doing at least 3 leetcode questions. But I can't yet relax, because at times when the question get a little too tougher then I start procrastinating.
For this keep listening some music too keep you away from distraction and try to improve your focus. 
Also thing is some other useless things come in between like going to classes and stuff like that.

Barely 20-25 days left now for me to graduate and to join that shitty company. Feels like this is the most desperate times of my life. I have no option but to crack a company no matter what in this last few weeks of my college life. Else I have to work for atleast 6 months in that shitty company and what not. This is now either DO or DIE situation. No place to hide. No way to avoid this. Either I face this challenge and succeed or fail and litteraly go down the dumps of my miserable life.
