### My previous attempt failed as I lacked consistency in  my methods therefore I am restarting this challenge

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0:Wednesday 10th November 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the entire chapter 4 in CTCI except one question in the exercise section and also did two or three leetcode questions but they were just very easy type of questions

**Thoughts:**  Need to do things faster because I took almost an entire day to complete an entire chapter from CTCI

### Day 1:Thursday 11th November 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Couldn't complete the 5th chapter bit manipulation in CTCI . It was taking a lot of time . Did two questions in leetcode which were good , I mean really good .They were https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-divisible-subset and https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate-iii/ Finally tried to do codeforces which I later stopped .

**Thoughts:**  Progress going very slowly . Need a better plan to include proper exercise

### Day 3:Saturday 13th November 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 6th chapter except for that egg drop problem which I will study properly later on . And did around three leetcode questions .A question called simple number II was explained deeply by fun4leetcode . 

**Thoughts:**  That explanation was extremely lucid and even though it took me an hour or two to understand it ,it was worth it .

**Today's Progress**: Yesterday I was out partying so  I did nothing . Did 3 leetcode questions which were the Ugly number II , Target sum and missing number

### Day 6:Tuesday 16th November 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Today I got very tired from intern work therefore I could not properly attempt leetcode questions . I was just watching some youtube videos only for leetcode questions which were meeting room II , trapping the rain water 

**Thoughts:**  Need a proper strategy for attempting leetcode questions .

### Day 7:Wednesday 17th November 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished my intern work but I got into a fight with my brother and father . I just wanted some personal space where I was doing work because it was hard for me to concentrate to study with my brother side to side .Anyways I kind of lost it and quit it and spend half of my day procrastinating on youtube 

**Thoughts:**  Need to make some recovery plan from frustation and stay calm and I also got this wonderful idea of already scouring some questions before hand doing them .

### Day 9:Friday 19th November 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Today I did 4 leetcode questions and 3 codeforces round #754 div 2 questions and tried to understand the 4th question (D) Treelabeling understood what needed to be done but still didn't understand the part where the implementation began .

**Thoughts:**  I am feeling great at the time of writing this because I have realised that I can change myself as I have effectively removed this bad habit of me watching youtube .

2. max-chunks-to-make-sorted
3. max-chunks-to-make-sorted-ii
4. flatten-nested-list-iterator
5. find-the-most-competitive-subsequence

### Day 10:Saturday 20th November 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Yesterday It took me about 5 hours to do these 4 leetcode questions and I was also reading the solutions so yeah  and i only managed to do one codeforce question before succumbing to the anxiety of end sem , btp and other useless things . I was this close to quiting my session at the 9th session .

**Thoughts:**  I am changed man and nothing can change this statement as I am sticking to my word and not wasting too much time in youtube or other useless stuff before finishing my sessions .But after my sessions  completed I wasted too much time in youtube which delayed my sleep and I woke up late next day :( .
