# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0:Wednesday 10th July 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the entire chapter 4 in CTCI except one question in the exercise section and also did two or three leetcode questions but they were just very easy type of questions

**Thoughts:**  Need to do things faster because I took almost an entire day to complete an entire chapter from CTCI
