# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0:Wednesday 10th November 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the entire chapter 4 in CTCI except one question in the exercise section and also did two or three leetcode questions but they were just very easy type of questions

**Thoughts:**  Need to do things faster because I took almost an entire day to complete an entire chapter from CTCI

### Day 1:Thursday 11th November 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Couldn't complete the 5th chapter bit manipulation in CTCI . It was taking a lot of time . Did two questions in leetcode which were good , I mean really good .They were https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-divisible-subset and https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate-iii/ Finally tried to do codeforces which I later stopped .

**Thoughts:**  Progress going very slowly . Need a better plan to include proper exercise
